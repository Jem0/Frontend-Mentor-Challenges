## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## Project difficulties

- While the code works, it is not DRY. The shift to object oriented programming might be useful in this case.
- Selecting the right target to drag and dropping the item in the correct position

## What I've learned

- Storing and retrieving objects with local storage
- Debouncing vs. Throttling. How to implement debounce to limit the number of times a function can execute.
- Use `getBoundingClientRect()` to get an element's position relative to the browser's viewport
