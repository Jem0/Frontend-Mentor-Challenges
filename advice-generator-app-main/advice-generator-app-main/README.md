# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## Project difficulties

- I started with a desktop first approach and I had trouble deciding breakpoints for website responsiveness.
- The hardest part of the project was recreating the hover effect in the design. I was not aware of the box-shadow property until this challenge.

## What I've learned

- Decide breakpoints based on the content rather than relying on resolutions of common devices.
- The box-shadow property syntax is: horizontal-offset / vertical-offset / blur / spread / color
