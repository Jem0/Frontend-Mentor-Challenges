## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## What I've learned

- Creating a right angled triangle with CSS
- To change the color of an SVG element, convert the hex color code to a [CSS filter](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) then apply the filter to the `<img>` tag.
