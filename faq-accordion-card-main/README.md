## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript

## Project difficulties

- The most difficult part of this design is making the stacked/layered illustrations responsive.
- Positioning all the images and hiding the overflowing divs correctly for the desktop display was also a challenge.

## What I've learned

- Positioning in CSS
- Set heights to `<div>`s containing positioned elements.
- The difference between HTML's img `srcset` vs `picture` tag. Use `srcset` for resolution switching (a more lightweight alternative) and `<picture>` for art direction.
